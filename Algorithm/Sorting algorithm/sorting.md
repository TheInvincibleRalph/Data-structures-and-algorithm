### Principles of Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are designed to arrange elements of a list in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order. Key principles include:

1. **Comparison-based Sorting**: Most sorting algorithms compare elements to determine their order.
2. **Stability**: A stable sort maintains the relative order of equal elements.
3. **In-place Sorting**: An in-place sort requires only a constant amount of extra space.
4. **Time Complexity**: The efficiency of sorting algorithms is often measured by their time complexity, usually expressed in Big O notation.

### Patterns in Sorting Algorithms
1. **Divide and Conquer**: Used in Merge Sort and Quick Sort, where the array is divided into sub-arrays that are sorted and merged.
2. **Swapping Elements**: Used in Bubble Sort and Quick Sort, where elements are swapped based on certain conditions.
3. **Selection**: Used in Selection Sort, where the smallest/largest element is selected and placed in the correct position.
4. **Insertion**: Used in Insertion Sort, where elements are inserted into their correct position within a sorted sublist.
5. **Heap Structure**: Used in Heap Sort, where a binary heap is used to maintain order.
6. **Digit-wise Sorting**: Used in Radix Sort, where sorting is performed on individual digits or parts of the elements.
