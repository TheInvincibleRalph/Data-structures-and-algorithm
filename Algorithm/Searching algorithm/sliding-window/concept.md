### Sliding Window Technique (Linear Search Problem)

The sliding window technique is an efficient method for solving problems involving subarrays or subsequences in an array. It is particularly useful for finding subarrays with certain properties, like a specific sum, maximum sum, or minimum length, with an optimal time complexity.

### Working Principle of the Sliding Window Technique

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define two pointers: `start` and `end`, both initially set to the beginning of the array.
   - Use a variable, `currentSum`, to keep track of the sum of the elements within the current window (subarray).
   
2. **Expanding the Window**:
   - Incrementally move the `end` pointer to expand the window by including more elements in the subarray.
   - Update `currentSum` by adding the new element pointed to by `end`.

3. **Shrinking the Window**:
   - Once the window satisfies the desired property (e.g., the sum is greater than a given value), move the `start` pointer to reduce the size of the window while still within the range of the desired property.
   - Update `currentSum` by subtracting the element pointed to by `start` as you move the `start` pointer.

4. **Updating the Result**:
   - Throughout the process, keep track of the optimal result (e.g., the minimum length of the subarray) based on the current window.

### Case Study: Minimum Length of Subarray with Sum Greater than a Given Value

**Problem Statement**:
Given an array `arr[]` of integers and a number `x`, find the minimum length of a subarray with a sum greater than `x`.

**Using the Sliding Window Technique**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `start` and `end` pointers are initialized at the beginning of the array.
   - `currentSum` is initialized to 0.
   - `minLength` is initialized to a large number, usually the maximum length an `int` type can hold (to keep track of the smallest subarray length).

2. **Algorithm**:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func findMinSubArrayLength(arr []int, x int) int {
    n := len(arr)
    if n == 0 {
        return 0
    }

    minLength := math.MaxInt32
    currentSum := 0
    start := 0

    for end := 0; end < n; end++ {
        currentSum += arr[end]

        // While the current sum is greater than x, update minLength and reduce window size
        for currentSum > x {
            minLength = min(minLength, end-start+1)
            currentSum -= arr[start]
            start++
        }
    }

    if minLength == math.MaxInt32 {
        return 0 // No valid subarray found
    }

    return minLength
}

func min(a, b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func main() {
    arr := []int{1, 4, 45, 6, 0, 19}
    x := 51
    result := findMinSubArrayLength(arr, x)
    if result == 0 {
        fmt.Println("No subarray with sum greater than", x)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Minimum length of subarray with sum greater than", x, "is", result)
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `minLength` is set to the maximum value that a 32-bit signed integer can hold which is (2^31 -1) using (`math.MaxInt32`), to track the minimum length.
   - `currentSum` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of the current subarray or window.
   - `start` is initialized to 0 to mark the start of the current window.

2. **Expand the Window**:
   - The `end` pointer iterates over each element in the array.
   - Add the current element `arr[end]` to `currentSum`.

3. **Shrink the Window**:
   - While `currentSum` is greater than `x`, update `minLength` to the minimum length found (`end - start + 1`). This formula accurately returns the length of the current window using the "1" to take into account the fact that indexing starts from zero.
   - Subtract the element `arr[start]` from `currentSum` and increment `start` to shrink the window from the left.

4. **Result**:
   - After iterating through the array, check if `minLength` was updated. If it is still `math.MaxInt32`, no valid subarray was found, so return 0.
   - Otherwise, return the `minLength`.

**Efficiency**:
The sliding window technique ensures that each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when shrinking), resulting in an O(n) time complexity, making it highly efficient for this problem.
